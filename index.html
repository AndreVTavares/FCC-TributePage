                <ul>
                    <li>"Would I rather be feared or loved? Easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me."</li>
                    <li>"Sometimes I'll start a sentence and I don't even know where it's going. I just hope I find it along the way."</li>
                    <li>"Guess what, I have flaws. What are they? Oh I don't know. I sing in the shower. Sometimes I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally I'll hit somebody with my car. So sue me"</li>
                    <li>"An office is for not dying. An office is a place to live life to the fullest, to the max an office is a place where dreams come true."</li>
                    <li>"Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked, but it's not like this compulsive need to be liked, like my need to be praised."</li>
                    <li>"I don't hate it. I just don't like it at all and it's terrible."</li>
                    <li>"Fool me once, strike one. Fool me twice, strike three."</li>
                    <li>"If I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice."</li>
                </ul>
